        <p><b>The following data is used for the site's function in response to user action:</b></p>
        <p>When the user views their timetable, this site's backend uses the user's selection to return timetable data relevant to their preferences.</p>
        <p>This data is not stored beyond the duration required to access the relevant timetable events and is not used for any additional purposes.</p>
        <p>Sets of frequently requested timetable events may be identified automatically by the site's backend in order to improve response times.
            This is anonymised and simply tracks overall frequency of requests from all users.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>When user consent is explicitly provided, additional data is used by the site as follows:</b></p>
        <p>Within the user's browser, a random user identifier is created. This is likely but not guaranteed to be unique. This identifier is solely for differentiating browser contexts and cannot be used to identify anything about a user.</p>
        <p>The user identifier is sent to this site's backend for the purposes of tracking the number of active users of the site.</p>
        <br>
        <p>No user data is collected, stored, or processed</p>
        <br>
        <p>This site does not send any identifiable information to any third-party services.</p>
